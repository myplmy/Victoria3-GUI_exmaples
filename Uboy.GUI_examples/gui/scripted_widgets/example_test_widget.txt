# GUI MODDING TUTORIAL - SCRIPTED WIDGETS
############################################
# This file registers your custom GUI widgets with the game
# 
# IMPORTANT: This file must be placed in:
# game/gui/scripted_widgets/
#
# Format: path/to/gui/file.gui = widget_name_from_that_file

# Register the main tutorial panels widget
# This tells the game to load tutorial_panels.gui and look for
# a widget named "gui_example_panels_widget"

# gui/gui_example_panels.gui = gui_example_panels_widget

# Register the button widget
# This creates the button that opens the tutorial panel
# gui/gui_example_panels.gui = gui_example_panel_button

# NOTES FOR MODDERS
############################################
# 
# 1. The left side is the path to your .gui file
#    It's relative to the game/ folder in your mod
#
# 2. The right side is the exact name of a widget in that file
#    It must match the "name = " property in the widget
#
# 3. You can have multiple lines pointing to the same file
#    if that file contains multiple root-level widgets
#
# 4. Make sure there are no typos - the game won't warn you
#    if it can't find the widget, it just won't appear
#
# 5. This file can have any name, as long as it's in the
#    scripted_widgets folder and has a .txt extension
